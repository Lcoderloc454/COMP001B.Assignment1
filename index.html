        <p class="question">
            What do I wanna learn about the CSS Course?
        </p>

        
        <p>
            For Starters I did originally took this course to code games like minecraft but then my vision got bigger so I want to see that through or at least get into a coding job that would do a lot of good so that some people would stop complaining how much things suck without doing something.
        </p>
        <p>
            And I do want to know about the layouts and coding blocks I need for any projects that can be worked on like how should I design a website to look like its from todays time or 2023 times or 2022 times or anything above all of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do hope I can learn the Coding blocks of what they do so I can know how to make projects like this be more eye candy to anyone.
