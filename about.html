        I did originally came to this class to learn how to code so I can do minecraft and game like projects for fun but then I did see more potential with technology so thats why I am still going rather than quitting.

        I like creating things so I can see what prosper can it bring and what chaos can it bring and what entertainment could it bring so I wanted to learn the blocks of coding and what they do so I can better remember it so coding projects would be more smooth.

        I like Games that has strategies and a story and creativity and very little micro transactions and a community that is not always toxic even though I dont listen to communities and do my own thing anyways and you wanna know why I picked crimson butterfly I think butterflies are cute thats why.
